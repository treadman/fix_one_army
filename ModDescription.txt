This mod addresses the issue where one army cannot kill one army due to the One Army Must Stand Guard setting.

The problem is,
    an order is executed where a single army attacks
    "analyze attack" says that 1 army kills 1 army
    but it doesn't
    the single attacker is killed, while the single defender survives

This only works when the offense kill rate is 50% or more. Less than 50% means that one army will not kill anything anyway.

When an order is executed on the order list,
    if the setting for One Army Must Stand Guard is on,
        if the offense kill rate is 50% or more,
            if the order is for troop movement,
                if this resulted in an attack,
                    if the attack failed,
                        if no defenders were killed,
                            kill that one defending army



When one army attacks one army, the defending army is killed.

    - The territory is still owned by the defender, but with 0 armies.

This mod will only work when the One Army Must Stand Guard setting is on.

    - This setting allows the defending army to survive
    - This mod fixes that

This only works when the offense kill rate is 50% or more.

    A kill rate of less than 50% means one army will not kill anything anyway.
