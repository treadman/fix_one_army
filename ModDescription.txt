With this mod, when one army attacks one army, the defending army will be killed, leaving the territory with zero armies.

This mod only works when the One Army Must Stand Guard setting is on.

This mod only works when the offense kill rate is 50% or more. Less than that means one army will not kill anything anyway.

This mod allows for that one army standing guard to be killed by one attacking army.
